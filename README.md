# AMinorWebsite1.0
In this project, we aim to revamp the UConn A Minor's website.  This will be a group project for ACM's Web Dev group.  The purpose of this project is to allow you all to gain real world experience, using relevant technologies, frameworks and libraries, such as Git, React.js, and Node.js.  This will help propel you into the world of web development, so let's get going!

This is a link to any relevant git commands that you may need to know throughout this project: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html

To make sure that you get the most out of this project, I strongly encourage you to familiarize yourselves with basic JavaScript, as it will be a huge part of this project.  

The stack we will be using is: React.js/Next.js/css


Do not worry if you don't know any of these frameworks or libraries.  The point of this project is to learn and to become better at using them, so as long as you try your best, you will be fine!

Setting up Node.js and npm is a very simple process.  To install and test Node.js and npm, please follow this tutorial.

Included in this folder is the hello.js file that was used in this tutorial to test if node and npm is installed properly; feel free to use it.

The following is a link to React.js's documentation.  Please follow it all the way through before proceeding.  This will allow you to gain a basic understanding of how to implement and use react.js in a web application.

Tasks to do after finishing the website:
1.) Use Python to create form emailing
2.) Create an admin panel with verified user login/password combinations that will allow moderators (such as President, VP, or Secretary) to make changes to Members DB (such as adding in new members, removing old members and transferring them to past members page, new albums, etc)
