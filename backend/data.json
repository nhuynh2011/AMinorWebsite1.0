          "When I joined the group in the Spring of 2018, I wanted to get invested into our group.  At the time, I had a huge interest in web development, and I was leading the web development group in the Computer Science club on campus, called Association for Computing Machienry.  I wanted to expand and test my skillset, so I decided that I needed to start some type of project.",
          "After looking at the A Minor website, I decided that I'd want to revamp it just to see what I could learn while doing so.  I can't even begin to state how much fun I had learning all of these new technologies that I've never used before, and being able to have the opportunity to work on something that us, as a group, can actually get some benefit out of.",
          "I was able to recruit one of my friends, Chris Shank, and he ended up being the front-end designer and developer for the website, while I primarily focused on the backend and data aspect of the site.  Overall, this entire experience has been something that I very much enjoyed, and I can't wait to continue this project and to update the layout and functionality of the site!"

He fills his free time with watching shows like \"Game of Thrones\", \"The Flash\", and \"How to Get Away with Murder\". While he takes pride in his Netflix-watching capabilities, he more so hopes to develop his singing capabilities with A Minor, in hopes of developing a music career later in life."

If you see her around, she’ll probably have a huge smile on her face and looooooves making new friends. If she weren’t completely dedicated to science, she’d probably end up being a \"professional\" public speaker for some sort of non-profit since she loves talking in front of people. Also, she connects to Elle Woods on a spiritual level. "

Her favorite artists are Marina and the Diamonds and The 1975. Aside from music and singing, Emma has a strong passion for Thai food, bubble tea, and chicken parmesan (although she is in the process of reducing her meat intake, so leaving behind chicken parm will be a traumatic experience). Emma has a deep love for animals and the environment. She is currently in the EcoHouse Learning Community on campus. Outside of rehearsal, you can find Emma procrastinating, eating, or attempting to make people laugh (typically, she just tells some really bad jokes)."

Apart from singing, Will likes to play video games, hang out with friends, and (most importantly) sleep. Despite his seemingly lax nature, he is always working hard to better himself and help those around him, while working towards his goal of being a pharmacist, and having fun along the way, of course!"
