####Developer Stack

This is a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) application that uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build our react application into a static site.

Next.js uses [styled-jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-jsx) package for component scoped css.

We are using [next-page-transitions](https://github.com/illinois/next-page-transitions) to animate page transitions.
